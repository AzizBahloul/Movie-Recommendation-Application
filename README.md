# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a movie recommendation system that uses machine learning to predict whether a user will like a movie based on various features such as movie name, release year, and rating. The system employs different machine learning models and techniques to provide recommendations.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for model training.
- Model training: Trains models using Random Forest and other classifiers.
- Model evaluation: Evaluates model performance with accuracy and classification reports.
- Grid search: Optimizes model hyperparameters to improve performance.
